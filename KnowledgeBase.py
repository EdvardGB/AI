# for the comaprable function, use a function that converts to CNF and considers the truthtable

# create many "rules of beliefs"/ first order logic rules, but make rules for the truthness of those rules based on variables such that
# the credability of a rule is not 100%, and therefore can be changed or more rules can be added to make it more credabel.
